Task 1: aFRR Activation Assessment Report
Date: 2025-09-22
============================================================

SUMMARY METRICS
------------------------------------------------------------
Total aFRR Activation (MW): 877.05
Total Imbalance Volume (MW): 2025.64
Average |aFRR Activation| / |Imbalance| Ratio: 0.3114
Max aFRR Activation (MW): 44.08
Max Imbalance Volume (MW): 113.57
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------
aFRR (automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve) is a secondary reserve used to restore
system frequency to nominal value after primary reserves (FCR) have responded. 
Its is activated automatically based on frequency deviations and imbvalance signal . 

The ratio of aFRR activation to total imbalance indicates:
- How much of the system imbalance is being covered by aFRR reserves
- The efficiency of the balancing market
- Whether sufficient reserves are available to cover imbalances

ASSESSMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
Low activation ratio (<0.5): aFRR covers less than half of imbalances,
suggesting other balancing mechanisms or reserves are also in use.
